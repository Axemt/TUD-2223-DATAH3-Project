    "In light of the recent climate crisis, alternative and sustainable modes of transportation rise as a valuable option to lower a city's carbon footprint. Additionally, there have been recent discussions on the walkability and accessibility of cities in relation to their quality of life. With so many important topics related to transportation in the spotlight, I thought it would be fit to examine datasets regarding it.\n",

    "To this end, we will study New York City's Citywide Mobility Survey, or CMS for short. NYC was picked for generally being understood to be a transport friendly city, and being a big city, it allows the city to collect a wide variety of diverse information about its citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "[The New York CMS](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?q=Citywide%20Mobility%20Survey&sortBy=relevance) is a yearly survey on the city's population to assess the citizen's view of transport, their usage and other demographic data about public and private transport users and is conducted by the Department of Transportation. This survey is comprised of several different dataset that contain information about the respondent, their household, each individual trip they made or their vehicles.\n",
